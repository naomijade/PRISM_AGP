Thank you for the help, but there are more of them...
If I could be of any help, let me know.
Nice place you got here. Thanks again.
..............
Those guys are extremely annoying.
PRISM network can eat my butt.
You're a cool dude, thanks.
What is this place?
Haven't I seen you before?
Is Lewis here? I wonder where he could've gone.
What's up with that thing on your chest?
I felt nothing before.
I don't know what happened... I just want to go home.
Don't tell me you've stuck me in the middle of nowhere.
I heard that The District was a wonderful place. Why does it look so drabby?
Can I hop on your sofa?
ACHOO!.... sorry, it's dusty here.
Please, leave me be for a moment.
They told me it would be over soon.
Why do you care?
If you have the chance, get out of this place.
It isn't safe here anymore.
What are you looking at?
I'm digging the vibe here, it's nice.
Do you have food? I'm hungry.
*cough*.... *cough*
You should make your bed once and awhile.
I can't stop thinking about her.
Have you seen my wife?
Leave, for your own good.
Those monsters are ugly. BLEH!
I'm bored.
Hey kid, got a second to spare?
I got the best deals in all The District.
I dropped a penny.
It's dark here...
They're coming for me... they're coming for me... they'll be here soon...
Lock the doors, dim the lights. 
Stop them at all costs.
I feel warm inside.
Do you see what I see?
We're happy to see a friendly face.
